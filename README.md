# Oliver's Homebrew Tap

[Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) is “the missing package manager for OS X”.

This repo is a Homebrew [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps.html) containing a collection of formulae for my projects.

## Usage

To install a package:

    brew tap osteele/homebrew-tap
    brew install multiclone
